# GitTraining


Welcome Alex, Anthony & Irfan
Here is the GitTraining project I created to let you practice on Git

Try to push you own firstname.txt file (with lorem ipsum text inside?) in this git project on main branch.

Some hint: You will need to branch the folder then do your modification, commit & push and at the end make a merge request to push the change to main branch ;)
